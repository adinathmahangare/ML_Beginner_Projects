#ML Beginner Projects 🚀
This repository contains some of the machine learning projects that I have done as a beginner. I have used Python as the programming language and Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab as the development environment. The projects cover various topics and techniques in machine learning, such as:

Data preprocessing and visualization 📊
Supervised learning (classification and regression) 🏫
Unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction) 🧩
Natural language processing 🗣️
Deep learning (neural networks and convolutional neural networks) 🧠
The projects are based on some of the popular datasets and challenges available online, such as:

Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
Wine Quality Prediction 🍷
Music Recommendation System 🎵
Handwriting Recognition ✍️
Stock Price Prediction 💹
Sentiment Analysis 😄
How to run the projects 🏃‍♂️
To run the projects, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

numpy 🔢
pandas 🐼
matplotlib 📈
seaborn 🌊
scikit-learn 🔬
tensorflow 💡
keras 🍰
nltk 📚
You can either clone this repository and run the notebooks locally, or open them in Google Colab and run them in the cloud. To open a notebook in Google Colab, click on the badge at the top of each notebook.
